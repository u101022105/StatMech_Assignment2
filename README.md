# StatMech Assignment 2

## Problem 1: Generalized dice

1. Modify your computer program to simulate the roll of N dice. Your program should let the dice have any number of sides, but the same number of sides for each die. The number of dice and the number of sides should be read in at the start of the program. One trial will consist of N rolls. Your program should calculate the sum of the N numbers that occur during each trial. It should also compare the results for the mean, variance, and standard deviation of that sum with the theoretical predictions. 

2. Test the calculations that we have carried out for the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the sum of the numbers on the dice. In each case, obtain data for a couple of different run-lengths. Investigate the cases listed below. (a) Two dice, each with ten sides. (b) Ten dice, each with twenty sides. 

3. Use your program to investigate the width of the distribution for various numbers of two-sided dice. Does the width of the distribution increase or decrease with increasing numbers of dice? Do your results agree with the theory?

## Problem 2: Computer simulations of mismatched dice

1. Write a computer program to compute the probability distribution for the sum of two dice when each die has an arbitrary number of sides. Run your program for dice of four and six sides. 

2. Modify the computer program you wrote for the previous problem to compute the probability distribution for the sum of three dice when each die has an arbitrary number of sides. Run your program once for all dice having six sides, and once for any combination you think interesting.
